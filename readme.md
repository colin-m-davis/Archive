# Archive

A VCS written in C!

Design principles:
- Unchanging history: Once you save something to the archive, you can't change the past.
- Decentralized: Multiple collaborators can work on a project, then come together later and combine their efforts.

Credit goes to Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler for [zlib](https://zlib.net/), which allowed me to implement compression and decompression of entire directories with relative ease.
